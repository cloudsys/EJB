* Demo for using  *EJB 3.1*, *JNDI* in *JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6* or *JBoss AS 7*.
* Demo for deploying EJB service via jar archive

Two components
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1. server side component:
+++++++++++++++++++++++++

The server component is comprised of stateful EJB and stateless EJB. It provides both an EJB JAR that is deployed to the server and a JAR file containing the remote business interfaces required by the remote client application.

2. client side component:
+++++++++++++++++++++++++

The remote client application depends on the remote business interfaces from the server component. Client side component run outside of JBoss, play a role as remote client. This application looks up the stateless and stateful beans via JNDI and invoke the method EJB service supplyed.

NOTE: `jboss-client.jar` should be add to client class path manually
