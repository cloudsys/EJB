ejb-in-war: Deployment of a WAR Containing an EJB
=================================================


What is it?
-----------

This example demonstrates the deployment of an *EJB 3.1* bean bundled in a war archive for deployment to *JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6* or *JBoss AS 7*. The project also includes a set of Aquillian tests for the managed bean and EJB.

The example follows the common "Hello World" pattern. These are the steps that occur:

1. A JSF page asks the user for their name.

2. On clicking submit, the name is sent to a managed bean namde `Greeter`.

3. On setting the name, the `Greeter` invokes the `GreeterEJB`, which was injected into the managed bean. Notice the field annotated with `@EJB`.

4. The response from invoking the `GreeterEJB` is stored in a field `message` of the managed bean.

5. The managed bean is annotated as `@SessionScoped`, so the same managed bean instance is used for the entire session. This ensures that the message is available when the page reloads and is displayed to the user.

System requirements

* Java 6.0 (Java SDK 1.6) or latter
