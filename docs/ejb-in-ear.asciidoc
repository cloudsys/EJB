ejb-in-ear: Deployment of an EAR Containing a JSF WAR and an EJB JAR
====================================================================


What is it?
-----------

This example demonstrates the deployment of an EAR artifact. The EAR contains: *JSF 2.0* WAR and an *EJB 3.1* JAR.

The example is composed of three maven projects, each with a shared parent. The projects are as follows:

1. `ejb`: This project contains the EJB code and can be built independently to produce the JAR archive.

2. `web`: This project contains the JSF pages and the managed bean.

3. `ear`: This project builds the EAR artifact and pulls in the ejb and web artifacts.

The root `pom.xml` builds each of the subprojects in the above order and deploys the EAR archive to the server.


The example follows the common "Hello World" pattern. These are the steps that occur:

1. A JSF page asks the user for their name.

2. On clicking _Greet_, the name is sent to a managed bean named `Greeter`.

3. On setting the name, the `Greeter` invokes the `GreeterEJB`, which was injected to the managed bean. Notice the field annotated with `@EJB`.

4. The response from invoking the `GreeterEJB` is stored in a field (message) of the managed bean.

5. The managed bean is annotated as `@SessionScoped`, so the same managed bean instance is used for the entire session. This ensures that the message is available when the page reloads and is displayed to the user.
