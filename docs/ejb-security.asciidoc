What is it?
-----------

This example demonstrates the use of Java EE declarative security to control access to EJB3 and Security in *JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6* or *JBoss AS 7*.

This demo takes the following steps to implement EJB security:

1. Define a security domain in the `standalone.xml` configuration file.
2. Add an application user with access rights to the application.
3. Add a security domain reference to `WEB-INF/jboss-web.xml`.
4. Add a security constraint to the `WEB-INF/web.xml` .
5. Add a security annotation to the EJB declaration.

When you review the code, note the allowed user role `guest` in the annotation -`@RolesAllowed`- is the same as the user role defined in step 2 above.


System requirements
-------------------

* Java 6.0 (Java SDK 1.6) or latter

* Maven 3.0 or latter.

* JBoss-eap-6.0 & JBoss-as-7.x


Security Test:
--------------

1. Access the application use authorized `user/role` 
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

* The application will be running at the following URL <http://localhost:8080/securityTest/>.

* When you access the application, you should get a browser login challenge.

* After a successful login using `kylin`/`redhat` which create in add application user, the browser will display the following security info:
----
Successfully called Secured EJB 

Principal : kylin

Remote User : kylin

Authentication Type : BASIC
----

2. Access the application use unauthorized `user/role`
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

* Change code, modify annotation `@RolesAllowed` value from `guest` to `guest1`, note guest is exist role we create in add application user.
----
@RolesAllowed({ "guest1" })

@ServletSecurity(@HttpConstraint(rolesAllowed="guest1"))
----

* Rebuild and redeploy and test from URL <http://localhost:8080/securityTest/>. You should get a security exception similar to the following:
----
HTTP Status 403 - Access to the requested resource has been denied


type Status report

message Access to the requested resource has been denied

description Access to the specified resource (Access to the requested resource has been denied) has been forbidden.
----
